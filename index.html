<p>Malleefowl is a tiny concert series for improvised/experimental music and performance in Boorloo/Perth, Western Australia, programming ambitious local performers and occasional visiting artists.</p>
<p>Concerts are pay-what-you-want with all money going to the artists. Dinner is provided for performers and audience to share afterwards, for which donations are appreciated to cover costs.</p>
<p>Malleefowl usually lives at the Meltham Cultural Precinct (the address of which will be sent when you RSVP). In 2022 we will be hosting some outdoor concerts and picnics as well.</p>
<p>We will endeavour to provide detailed accessibility info for each show, but please get in touch with any further concerns or questions.</p>

<p><i>Malleefowl acknowledges the Whadjuk people of the Noongar nation as the custodians of the land on which we are based.</i></p>
