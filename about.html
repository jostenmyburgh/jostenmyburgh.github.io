<p>Malleefowl are seldom-seen Australian birds that spend much of their year carefully looking after a clutch of eggs, constructing an elaborate mound to maintain a consistent temperature under the ground for incubation. This is a tenuous metaphor for the way the musicians who play at this series work: they spend a lot of time caring for ways of making music that are obscure but which slowly grow into beautiful and distinct things through the patient and committed work of the artists.<br><br>
  
  There is no clear genre of music that happens at Malleefowl, and on a given night you might hear songs, improvised performances, and chamber music-style compositions, or electronic pieces written for loudspeakers. Most of it is quiet and bristling with detail, but it can be loud and engrossing as well. Malleefowl has its own atmosphere and curatorial focus, and the kind of music that happens here is a little distinct from other experimental music series' you might know in Perth. The best way to find out about the music is to be there.
