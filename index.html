<p>Malleefowl is a tiny concert series for improvised/experimental music and performance in Boorloo/Perth, Western Australia, programming ambitious local performers and occasional visiting artists.</p>
<p>Concerts are pay-what-you-want with all money going to the artists. Dinner is provided for performers and audience to share afterwards, for which donations are appreciated to cover costs.</p>
<p>Malleefowl lives at the Meltham Cultural Precinct. The address of the venue will be sent when you RSVP.</p>
<p>When the weather is good, Malleefowl happens outdoors in the garden, which is ramp accessible. There is a 14cm step at the doorway to access the house or bathrooms. Please get in touch with any accessibility concerns.</p>
