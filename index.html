<p>Malleefowl is a tiny concert series for improvised, experimental and electro-acoustic music in Boorloo/Perth, Western Australia, programming ambitious local performers and occasional visiting artists.</p>
<p>Malleefowl lives at the Meltham Cultural Precinct. The address will be sent to you once you RSVP to a concert via our gmail address below. The venue has a 14cm step at the doorway to access the house or bathrooms, but concerts can be held in the garden when the weather's good. Get in touch with any accessibility concerns.</p>
