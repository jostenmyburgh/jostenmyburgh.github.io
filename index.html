<p>Malleefowl is a concert series for experimental music in Boorloo on Whadjuk Noongar country (Perth, Western Australia). Performances at Malleefowl draw from a wide-range of approaches but share a playful, exploratory approach to music-making, and a high level of care and attention to detail. Our programs involve work by ambitious local artists as well as scores & electro-acoustic works by contemporary composers internationally. Malleefowl concerts are recorded professionally and published on this website.</p>
